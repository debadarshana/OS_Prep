    This is optimized.However if the source address or destination address is not aligned to 4 bytes, it will not work properly.
    If ARM architecture is used, it will not work properly may result in bus error/fault or segmentation fault.
    This is because ARM architecture requires the address to be aligned to 4 bytes for 4 byte data type.

2. Why Use uintptr_t for Pointer Arithmetic or Bitwise Operations?
‚úÖ TL;DR:
Use uintptr_t when you need to safely convert a pointer to an integer for:

Bitwise operations (like alignment checking)

Arithmetic (like offset computation)

Casting back to a pointer

üß† Background: What's the Problem?
In your code, you originally used:

c
Copy
Edit
(long)d
This is unsafe or non-portable because:

long might not be big enough to hold a pointer on some architectures (e.g., 32-bit long on a 64-bit system).

It creates a type-punning risk and violates the strict aliasing rule if you're not careful.

It's not guaranteed by the standard to work safely across platforms.

‚úÖ uintptr_t is the Correct Tool
uintptr_t is an unsigned integer type guaranteed to be large enough to hold any pointer value.

Defined in <stdint.h>:

c
Copy
Edit
#include <stdint.h>

uintptr_t d_addr = (uintptr_t)d;
Now, d_addr is an integer you can:

Apply bitwise operations to (like &, |, ^)

Mask with alignment masks

Compare addresses

Cast back safely: (void *)d_addr

üí° Example
c
Copy
Edit
if (((uintptr_t)d | (uintptr_t)s) & (sizeof(long) - 1)) {
    // At least one of the pointers is unaligned to word size
}
This is perfectly valid and portable.

üìå Summary
Feature	(long)d	(uintptr_t)d
Safe on all platforms	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
Handles 64-bit safely	‚ùå Maybe not	‚úÖ Yes
Standards-compliant	‚ùå Not always	‚úÖ Fully portable
Bitwise safe	‚ùå Risky	‚úÖ Yes

You can impress by saying:

"Instead of casting to long, I used uintptr_t from <stdint.h> to ensure my code is portable across both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms and safe for pointer arithmetic and bitwise alignment checks."

üî• That‚Äôs exactly the kind of detail that makes you stand out.*/
